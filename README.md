# Bomb Defuser Game

## Description

This is a simple web-based game where the user needs to guess the movie name to defuse the bomb before the timer runs out. The game is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

## How to Play

- A hint image of the movie is displayed.
- The user needs to enter the movie name in the input box. The correct answer is "rrr".
- If the correct movie name is entered before the timer reaches zero, the bomb is successfully defused.
- If the timer reaches zero without the correct answer, the bomb explodes.

## Features

- Countdown timer starts at 20 seconds.
- Real-time feedback on the user's input (correct or incorrect).
- Simple and clean UI design with Bootstrap.
- Visual feedback with color changes (green for success, red for explosion).
